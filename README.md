# Binary-Classification-with-a-Bank-Dataset
Kaggle comptition

Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Marketing Dataset dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

steps we have to follow:-
      [Input Data / Features]
          ↓
    ┌────────────────────┐
    │  Machine Learning  │
    │      Model         │
    └────────────────────┘
          ↓
   [Probability Output]
        e.g. 0.87
          ↓
 ┌───────────────┐
 │ Threshold     │  →  If probability ≥ 0.5 → Class 1
 │ (usually 0.5) │      else → Class 0
 └───────────────┘
          ↓
    [Final Label]
   Class 1 = "Yes"
   Class 0 = "No"

work flow in simple terms:

[Data Collection] → [Feature Selection] → [Model Training] → [Prediction] → [Evaluation]
